As the name already implies this project shall make the use of OAuth 2.0 easier in Android Apps. Android offers many possibilities for mobile applications to share content and to use online services that enhance their features. However, it would be a shame not to use the latest open protocol that allows secure API authorization.

In addition to the basic Bearer token authentication it also supports MAC tokens and other -user implemented- extensions.
The goal is to make it possible to use OAuth 2.0 without any specific knowledge about OAuth and how to handle the tokens. The library should take care about the most basic things, so you only need to know how to handle the API you want to access.

This library is currently developed to satisfy the requirements of the following OAuth 2.0 drafts:
	- draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16  
	  (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16)#

	- draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-06
	- draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-00
	  
		  
Since theses are only drafts and the protocols specification is still in progress, the library still needs a lot of development and adjustment.


For any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
