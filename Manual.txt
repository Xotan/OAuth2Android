Before you begin
=============
Before you start coding you need the following two things:
	
	* The library
	-----------------
	Download the library (the jar file will do) and import it into your application.
	If you don't have a copy of the library goto:  ......
	
	* OAuth Credentials
	-----------------------------
	Go to the webpage of your service provider and register the application you want to develop. 
	Usually the service provider wants to know what your application does and whether it is a web-application
	or a desktop application. This library is especially made for Android Apps, so you might want to register a
	mobile application (you can choose "desktop application" if the service provider doesn't give you any other
	choices). 
	You can give your application a logo and a webpage that a user will be referred to if he desires more
	information. Also you have to give a so-called "Redirect URI": this is a URI the server redirects the
	client to after a request has been made. Installed applications like mobile apps don't use redirect URIs, the 
	redirect URI must be something like "oob" (out of band). See the service provider's documentation for details.
	
	In return for registering you get a set of credentials:
				- "application key" or "client id"
				- "application secret" or "client secret"
	write them down, or save them somewhere, because you will need them later.
	

Start programming
===============
Before you start programming, there are two things you might want to find out first. In the documentation
of your service provider look for:

		* Authorization method or How to get an access token. 
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		In order to get the first access token, the resource owner (the user) needs to authorize the client (your application) to access 
		his data on the service provider's servers. The OAuth protocol specifies different protocol flows on how to get this authorization
		(for example the Authorization-Code-Flow). Read the sections of the documentation that specify which flow the service provider supports. 
		If there is something like: ".... the user needs to copy and paste this code into his application...." then the service
		provider wants you to use the Authorization-Code-Flow.
		This is what you need to know.
	
		* Token Type
		-------------------
		You need to know what kind of tokens the provider issues. Mostly, they use the simplest one : the BEARER-Token.
	 	A bearer token has only a single string looking like this:
	 	access_token = "1/Hug7230dkjnISDnjk1067Hku83"
	 	A second token type which this library currently supports is the MAC token which also uses a token secret to create a signature for 
	 	your messages.
	 	If you are not sure, which token type your provider uses, leave it be and we will try the default type.
 

In order for your application to be able to connect to the Internet, you need to edit your "AndroidManifest.xml" and add this line:

 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
 
 
 
 Initialization
 -----------------	
 Now you can begin programming :
 
 
 1) Initialize a Client with the OAuth credentials given to you by the service provider earlier:
 
		org.gerstner.oauth2android.Client  client = new Client(clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri);
		
		
 2) Initialize a Server with the URLs that the service provider wants you to use:
 
		org.gerstner.oauth2android.Server server = new Server(accessTokenEndpoint, requestEndpoint, authotizationEndpoint);
 	
 	
 3) Define which token type you are using :
 
 	  org.gerstner.oauth2android.token.TokenTypeDefinition tokenTypeDefinition = new BearerTokenTypeDefinition();  // for BEARER Tokens
 	  org.gerstner.oauth2android.token.TokenTypeDefinition tokenTypeDefinition = new MacTokenTypeDefinition();     // for MAC Tokens
 	  org.gerstner.oauth2android.token.TokenTypeDefinition tokenTypeDefinition = new DefaultTokenTypeDefinition();  // if you don't know try this
 	  
 	  
 4) Initialize the OAuth-Object with this parameters:
 
 	 org.gerstner.oauth2android.OAuth oAuth = new OAuth( server, client, tokenTypeDefinition );
 	  

 5) some service providers want you to specify the "scope" of the authorization - which resources your application
 actually wants to access. For example if your application wants to download photos from a private photo album
 the scope might be something like: "read/myPhotoAlbum"
 How the scope is defined is up to the service provider. Read the service providers API - documentation for more information.
 
 	oAuth.addScope( scope );			// expects a single String - a single scope. You can call this many times.
 	
 	or
 	
 	oAuth.setScope( scopeArray );  // expects a String-Array containing all scopes 


Now you are ready to go. The OAuth-Object is used to handle all communication to the service provider.
With the given configuration it has all the necessary information to make authorized calls to the API.


Special
-----------
Here are a few things you might want to configure your Server with. But you don't need to - just use this if your service provider
wants something out of the ordinary.
	
	a)  Set the preferred HTTP - Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) the service provider wants you to use for accessing a protected resource.

		server.setPreferredHttpMethod( Connection.HTTP_METHOD_GET )			// use the GET method
		
  	b)  If the service provider doesn't want you to use the "Authorization"-Header for presenting the Access-Token or if for some reason you run into
	    unexpected difficulties with your device, then you may present it in another way.
	    But be aware that this is really not recommendable. Your service provider HAS to be able to use the authorization header (in accordance
	    with the OAuth 2.0 specification), and not all token types can be handled otherwise.

  		server.useAuthorizationHeader( false );	// the Access Token will be presented in the requests body
  		

Request Authorization
==================
This is the part, where your application has to ask the user for access to the service provider. Or more correctly put: it has to ask the owner of the 
protected resources for authorization. This gives the user of your application (the user may be the owner himself, but doesn't necessarily have to be)
the right to read or manipulate the protected resources.
This library provides three different ways to do so:

	* authorization code
	-----------------------------
	This is the recommended way to use. 
	It works like this: 
		 
	  5) use the OAuth object (you created in step 4) to get the URI to the Authorization Server with all the parameters you need.
	
		String authorizationUri =	oAuth.returnAuthorizationRequestUri();   

     6) take this URI-String and call Androids web browser
		
		Uri uri = Uri.parse( authorizationUri );
	        Intent intent = new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri );
	        startActivity( intent );
        
    7) the browser will open and the user will be directed to the URI that you specified earlier. This is a website of the service provider 
       where the user asks the resource owner (if it's not himself) to login and authorize your application to access the resources.
       This is the last time the user or resource owner will be asked for a password, and in addition to that your application doesn't even come
       in contact with the password.
       The website should display some information on what kind of application you developed (according to the descriptions you gave before during
       registration) and which resources the application wants to access.
       If the Resource Owner accepts and authorizes your application, the website will display an authorization code.
       It is a fairly simple code (so the user can memorize it for a few seconds)
       
   8) The user now copies the code (Android can do that) and closes the web browser (maybe he wants to log out first).
       The application will appear again, and you should provide a text input field for the user to paste the code to.
       
   9) Now you can read the code from the text input field into a String and pass it to this method:
       
	       executeAccessTokenRequest( String authorizationCode );
	       
	     If everything goes as planned, you should get an access token in the response. This method returns a Response object, which you can read and
	     play around with but you don't really need it. The access token will automatically be detected and put into your client object.
	       
		
		*user password credentials
		---------------------------------------
		If you can't open a web browser, you can ask the resource owner to input his "username" and "password" directly into you application. This method is only included in the
		library, because it is possible. It is not very elegant though. Of course you have to provide two input fields for the resource owner to input his credentials. Those you can read 
		and pass along to this method:
		
		executeAccessTokenRequest( username, password );
		
		Please be advised that you must not save these credentials under any circumstances.
		
		
		*client credentials
		--------------------------
		If your application is only handling non-protected resources (for example if the application is also the resource owner) the service provider might accept only the client credentials 
		for authorization. 
		
		executeAccessTokenRequest();			// since the application already knows the client credentials no parameters are needed here
		
		


Request Protected Resource
=======================
To access the protected resources you need to know more about how to work with the API of your service provider.
The resource should have a URI pointing to it, e.g.: https://www.myService.com/resource
It may be that you call a single resource with a specific URI, as in:  https://www.myService.com/resource/Me/MyPhotoAlbum/102.jpg
Or you have to provide additional parameters: user="Me", album="MyPhotoAlbum", photo="102.jpg"
Read the API documentation on how to access the resources.
Here is an example on how it works:

10)	  List<NameValuePair> parameter = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();     // create a list for parameters
        parameter.add(new BasicNameValuePair("photo", "102.jpg")); 						 // add a parameter (here: photo=102.jpg)
        String requestUri = "/request";			// only the last part (e.g: "https://www.myService.com/resource"  -> requestUri= "/resource"
 
 
 11)   call
			Response response = 	executeProtectedResourceRequest( requestUri, parameter );

12) The resource you requested is now included in the response object. You can extract it for example by calling 

			response.getResponseString();


(.....)



Example:
--------------
This is what your code could look like right now:


// your imports
import org.gerstner.oauth2android.Client;
import org.gerstner.oauth2android.Server;
import org.gerstner.oauth2android.OAuth;
import org.gerstner.oauth2android.token.TokenTypeDefinition;


// initializations

 Server server = new Server( accessTokenEndpoint, requestEndpoint, authotizationEndpoint );
 Client  client = new Client( clientId, clientSecret, redirectUri );
 TokenTypeDefinition tokenTypeDefinition = new BearerTokenTypeDefinition();  
 OAuth oAuth = new OAuth( server, client, tokenTypeDefinition );
 oAuth.addScope( "photos" );
 oAuth.addScope( "friends" );
 oAuth.addScope( "private" );
 
 
 // request Authorization
 
 String authorizationUri =	oAuth.returnAuthorizationRequestUri();   
 Uri uri = Uri.parse( authorizationUri );
 Intent intent = new Intent( Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri );
 startActivity( intent );
 
 // provide text input field for authorization code here
 
  // request access Token
  List<NameValuePair> parameter = new ArrayList<NameValuePair>();    
  parameter.add(new BasicNameValuePair("photo", "1.jpg")); 						
  String requestUri = "/request";			
 
 Response response = 	executeProtectedResourceRequest( requestUri, parameter );
 
  String result =  response.getResponseString();
  
  // do something with the resulting String....
