        This Package contains all OAuth specific <code>Exceptions</code>. <br>
        Every Exception in this package extends the <code>OAuthException</code>. <code>OAuthExceptions</code> have more parameters than a
        normal <code>Exception</code>. They can contain an <it>error</it> String, a more detailed <it>error description</it> and a <it>url</it> leading to a website
    with more detailed informations about the error. If those parameters are acutally present depends on the <code>Exception</code> and the server
    returning the error.<br>
    For more informations see {@link org.gerstner.oauth2android.exception.OAuthException}
